This is a random thing I made to find your phone. This can be useful when your phone gets stolen.

## Dependencies

Termux:
- pulseaudio
- ffplay
- node

Node:
- express

## Usage

WARNING: You need another device connected on the same network for this to work!

Run `main.sh` in Termux (don't worry if a pulseaudio error appears). To set the alarm off, go to <your phone's IP>:3000 on another device and press "Alarm". To turn it off, press it again.
